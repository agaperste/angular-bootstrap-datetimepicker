## Support the project
I know this is a tiny directive but many people use it in production (high 5 to all of us) - if you happen to use this directive please click the star button (at the top of the page) - it means a lot to all the contributors.

## Usage with Angular CLI
We use npm for dependency management, run

```shell
npm install --save angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker
```

This will copy the angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker files into your `node_modules` folder, along with its dependencies.

## Configuration

Use the automated configuration generator (please let me know if it does not work for your use case!), or read the documentation below.

### First day of week

The first day of the week is also determined by moment's locale settings. For example, setting the locale to ```'fr'```
will cause Monday to be the first day of the week.  

### Display of year, month, day, hour, am/pm, and minute formats

The format of hours and minutes is also determined by [moment's i18n settings](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/).

hours are displayed using 'll' as the format.
minutes are displayed using 'lll' as the format. 

I recommend you use the default locale settings from Moment (if they are incorrect, submit a PR to moment to correct the settings)
If for some reason the default Moment settings will not work, you can [customize the existing locale](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/) or [create a custom locale](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/adding-locale/) with the desired formats.

### Testing
This directive was written using TDD and all enhancements and changes have related tests.

We use karma and jshint to ensure the quality of the code. The easiest way to run these checks is to use gulp:

```shell
npm install
npm test
```

The karma task will try to open Chrome as a browser in which to run the tests.
Make sure Chrome is available or change the browsers setting in karma.config.js
